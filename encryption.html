	<h1>Encryption</h1>
	<p>Encryption is the process of converting information or data into a code, especially to prevent unauthorized access.</p>
	<p>Encryption is commonly used in digital communication and data storage to protect sensitive information from being accessed by unauthorized parties. There are different types of encryption techniques, including symmetric encryption, asymmetric encryption, and hash functions.</p>
	<p>Symmetric encryption uses the same key to both encrypt and decrypt the data, while asymmetric encryption uses different keys for encryption and decryption. Hash functions are used to create a fixed-length code from a message, making it difficult to reverse the process and discover the original message.</p>
	<p>Encryption is an important tool for protecting sensitive information, such as personal data, financial information, and passwords. It is widely used in online transactions, secure communication, and data storage.</p>
