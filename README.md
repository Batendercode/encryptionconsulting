Encryption methods

 

Caesar cipher
The Caesar cipher is the easiest and most widely used encryption method. It is also called Caesar code, Caesar move or move cipher.

It can also be called a type of encryption. In the cipher, each character is moved to the right or left in a fixed amount in the plaintext alphabet. For example, in a cipher with the number of moves 3, letter A is replaced by B, letter A is replaced by G.

The cipher was named after the Roman emperor Gaius Julius Caesar. He used this cipher with his generals.

This cipher is often used as part of many more complex ciphers, such as the Wigener cipher. The Caesar cipher is still used in the ROT13 system. Like all monolithic ciphers, the Caesar cipher is easily broken and is not used at all in practice.

Usage history
The Caesar cipher is named after Gaius Julius Caesar. He used the cipher by moving it three places to the left.
Gaius Suetonius Tranquille used it to send military information by moving it to three places, according to the Life of the Twelve Caesars. Although Caesar remains in history as the first cipher user, we know that he used other encryption methods before. If there was a confidential transmission, he used this cipher, for example, he changed the alphabetical order. Then there was no way to understand any words. If he wanted to understand the text, he had to put the fourth letter. For example, the letter A is B..|Guius Suetonius Tranquille|Lives of the Twelve Caesars 56
His nephew, Augustus, followed this encryption method in use. But he insisted on moving one place to the right. When deciphering, he substituted A for A and B for A. Guy Suetonius Tranquille, Lives of the Twelve Caesars 88
There is evidence that Julius Caesar used more complicated schemes.
It is unclear how effective Caesar's encryption method was. But since many of Caesar's enemies were illiterate, the cipher was thought to be written in a different language, so the cipher was quite secure. There is no record of breaking the cipher. The earliest record is found in the writings of al-Kindi, who lived in the 9th century. Caesar's Cipher move one place move back The Mezuzah is used to encrypt the names of God. This may have been the case in the early days, when the Jewish people were not allowed to believe in the Mezuzah. In the 19th century, a simple cipher was used to exchange information in the advertising section of the newspaper. David Kahn wrote in the Times that the public was not given their turn in secret communications. In 1915, the Caesar cipher was used. The Russian army used this cipher instead of difficult ciphers. Because difficult ciphers were difficult for the troops, but it was not difficult for the German and Austrian troops to find this cipher.
Shifted to thirteen places, the cipher is used in the ROT13] algorithm, which is widely used by Usenet in the plain text obfuscation method. It is often used to hide spoilers. The Vigener cipher uses the Caesar cipher with different shifts. The shift is defined by a keyword. If the length of the key is equal to the length of the text, it becomes an unbreakable cipher. In 2006, Mafia boss Bernardo Provenzano was arrested in Sicily for using the Caesar cipher in the cryptanalysis of his messages. Provenzano used the cipher where the letter "A" is in the 4th place and the letter "–ê" is in the 5th place.
For ease of use, the Caesar cipher uses 2 disks of different diameters inserted into a common axis with alphabets written on their edges. First, the disks are aligned with the letters on each disk, and then by moving how many places, the Caesar cipher is obtained. For example, if we move the letter A to the letter B, we get a cipher shifted 3 places to the left.

Crack the cipher
The Caesar cipher is easily broken even if only the ciphertext is known. Two different cases can be considered:

the attacker knows that he used a simple cipher, but does not know whether it is a real Caesar cipher.

the hacker knows he used the Caesar cipher, but doesn't know how many places he moved.

In the first case, the cipher can be quickly broken by replacing it, for example, frequency analysis is the same. Using this method, he can quickly tell from the repetition of the cipher that it is a Caesar cipher.

In the second case, breaking the cipher is even easier. There is not much room to move, so you can crack the code with a lot of force. The technique of doing this is to take a part of the encrypted word and put it in all possible moves (42 in Kazakh). Sometimes it is also called the technique of "closing of the simple component".

This method can be used in another way - the entire alphabet is written under each letter starting with this letter. This method is accelerated if the pre-written alphabet strips are ready. For this, an encrypted word should appear in one field, then we will see the correct text in the remaining part.

Plaintext has only one option for re-encryption. And if it is very short, there may be several versions of the word. For example, when the encrypted word MPQY is re-encrypted, it is "aden" and "know" (the encrypted text is written in English). In the same way, the word "ALIIP" can be deciphered as "dolls" or "wheel"; "AFCCP" can be decoded in several ways as "jolly" or "cheer".
